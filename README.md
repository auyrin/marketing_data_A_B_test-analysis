# marketing_data_A_B_test-analysis
AB test analysis on marketing data. we want to see if an ad campaign was successful.

## objective
- the aim of the test was to check if the campaign was successful, and how much of its success was due to ads.

# processes
- for sanity check; i reduced the ad data rows to the lenght off psa. the difference in their conversions was still statistically significant.
- I performed hypothesis tests on their conversion rates to verify their statistical significance.
- i explored the data to find the days and hours with the most conversions.
- i gave my recommendations based on the results of my analysis.
