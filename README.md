# marketing_data_A_B_test-analysis
AB test analysis on marketing data. we want to see if the ad campaign is successful.

the data was gotten from kaggle. and i wrote the notebook on kaggle.

for sanity check; i reduced the ad data rows to the lenght off psa. the difference in their conversions was still statistically significant.

I performed hypothesis tests on their conversion rates to verify their statistical significance.

After confirming its significance, i explored the data to find the days and hours with the most conversions.

then i gave my recommendations based on the results of my analysis.
