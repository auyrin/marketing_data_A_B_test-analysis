# marketing_data_A_B_test-analysis
AB test analysis on marketing data. we want to see if the ad campaign is successful.

- the aim of the test was to check if the campaign was successful, and how much of its success was due to ads.

- the data was gotten from kaggle. i also wrote the notebook on kaggle.

- for sanity check; i reduced the ad data rows to the lenght off psa. the difference in their conversions was still statistically significant.

- I performed hypothesis tests on their conversion rates to verify their statistical significance.

  - After confirming its significance, i explored the data to find the days and hours with the most conversions.

  - then i gave my recommendations based on the results of my analysis.
